\newline
\newline
\textbf{\textit{List of Requirements}}\\\\ (Mainly based on Airbus A350-900 \autocite{Airbus_A350-900})
\\ 

\textbf{Design and Performance\label{Design_and_performance}}

    \item Number of engines: 2
\end{itemize}
\pagebreak
\textbf{Operational requirements\label{Operational_requirements}}

\subsection{Assignment 1.2\label{Assignment_1.2}}
\textbf{Assignment}: On the basis of the list of Requirements elicited
in the previous step, identify a good list of reference aircraft and
collect data to be used as meaningful statistical population.\\ \\ \\ 

Several commercial aicrafts from \textit{Airbus} and \textit{Boeing} have been chosen, with
the goal of having a statistical population to compare to in mind, as well as a reference list for 
inspiration with consolidated concept designs and technologies.\\
Acquiring all the data for the entire population was not easy, as their availability is scattered and varies from source
to source.\\
Despite the overall scarcity of clear, organized and transparent information, a significant amount of statistically meaningful
data has been acquired and ordered in the following landscape tables.\\ \\ 
A \textit{GNU/Octave} \autocite{Octave} (or Matlab) script that elaborates all the data has been written, with the goal
of easy readability in mind, as everything has been split into functions. \\
The script and its functions are publicly available in this works' \textit{GitHub} repository \autocite{Airbus_replacement_repo} (\textit{Code} directory) and 
licensed under the \textit{GNU GPL v3} license.\\ 
Bear in mind that Octave outputs all the plots at once when you run the whole script, while on Matlab
you may need to run each separate Section, as some versions overwrite \textit{figure()} when it's implemented
within a custom function.\\ 
This will of course depend on the Matlab version you're currently running.\\ The code itself is short and easy to read,
while also being full of step-by-step comments.

\subsection{Assignment 1.3\label{Assignment_1.3}}
\textbf{Assignment}: \textit{Critical Analysis of statistical trends}.
Verify whether your statistical population fits the trend reported in
literature (e.g. Raymer) or suggest improvements to the simple
mathematical models (e.g. updates of coefficients).\\ \\ \\ 

Among all of the acquired data, the \textit{Empty Mass Fraction} is a particularly significant
statistical trend. \\
The raw data trend has been comparatively plot in the script, along with an improved algorithm, 
proposed by \textit{Daniel P. Raymer} \autocite{Raymer_Daniel}.

\begin{figure}[h!]

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Sources/Plots_and_Pictures/Empty_mass_trend.png}\\
    \label{Empty_mass_trend}
    \caption{\textit{Empty Mass Trend}}
\end{figure} 

As clearly visible, the improved trend is substantially more in line with the acquired data.


\pagebreak
\subsection{Assignment 1.4\label{Assignments_1.4}}
\textbf{Assignment}: \textit{Guess data estimation for the reference
case study}. Apply the original or improved statistical trends to
perform the first guess data estimation for the reference case
study. Please, report all iterations needed to converge to the
design maximum take-off mass.\\ \\ \\ 

The first hypothesis for the \textit{MTOW} estimation was using the \textit{True Air Speed}
at an altitude of 10 km, as that would be a worse case scenario compared to the goal design
of a cruise Mach of 0.85. \\ 
The entire calculation is made assuming a range of 11 km and a maximum range of 15 km, as well as
a 50 metric tonnes design payload, with the awareness that a lighter payload might be necessary
in order to improve range.\\ \\
The function \begin{verbatim} mtow_range_plotter.m \end{verbatim} takes a guess \textit{MTOW} value as one of its inputs, generates some mass coefficients,
elaborates and uses them to finally return the desired \textit{MTOW} as one of its outputs (see repository \autocite{Airbus_replacement_repo} for the implementation).\\ 
The function also plots the MTOW as a function of the range.\\
One issue that has been immediately noticed is an instability with the plot around 15000 km,
therefore a compromise payload of 40 metric tonnes has been used for this specific plot, in order to 
get a more accurate visualization. \\ 
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \phantomsection
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Sources/Plots_and_Pictures/MTOW_range.png}
    \label{MTOW_Range}
    \caption{MTOW-Range}
\end{figure}
\clearpage
Similarly, with the function \autocite{Airbus_replacement_repo}
\begin{verbatim}

    mtow_payload_plotter.m

\end{verbatim}
the \textit{MTOW} has been plotted as a function of the payload with the design
range of 11000 km first, then with the maximum range of 15000 km, as pictured below.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \phantomsection
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Sources/Plots_and_Pictures/MTOW_payload.png}

    \label{MTOW_Payload_15}
    \caption{MTOW-Payload (15000 km)}
\end{figure}
As you can see, there are areas where the function drops to a null value,
but that's because the MTOW ceases to have a physical meaning above or below certain
thresholds, depending on the input parameters. \\ 
However there seems to be a convergence slightly above 40 metric tonnes.

\section{Assignment 2\label{Assignment_2}}
\subsection{Assignment 2.1 and 2.2\label{Assignment_2.1}}
\textbf{Assignment:} Perform a Tradeoff and identify a suitable design point that 
guarantees the aircraft concept to be competitive with A350 and competitors. \\ \\ \\ 
\textbf{Assignment:} Create a Payload-Range Diagram representative of your aircraft concept. 
On the basis of the results achieved, draw different Payload-Range diagrams to explore 
the possibility to create a family concept.\\ \\ \\ 


Another key aspect to take into consideration is how the \textit{Payload} changes with 
 range, considering that fuel contribution to the total mass is obviously going
to change over time, thus influencing other factors as well. \\ 
The fuel volume of the Airbus A350 ($141 \ m^3$) as well as
the fuel itself (\textit{AVGAS}) have been taken as a reference point.\\ 
In order to better represent this function within a family of aircrafts that
is compatible with our statistical sample, a variation around the design point values has been 
taken into account.\\ 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Payload variation: $\pm \ 5000 \ kg$
    \item MTOW variation: $\left \{ {0.88 \ MTOW, 1.077 \ MTOW} \right \} \ kg$
    \item Range variation: $\pm \ 500 \ km$
\end{itemize}

The result is calculated and plotted with the function \autocite{Airbus_replacement_repo}
\begin{verbatim}
    payload_range_plotter.m
\end{verbatim}
which takes into consideration all the parameters involving the fuel, as well as other design values for the airplane.\\ 
The plotter can be called with input variations as many times as the user needs, while the `\textit{On}' parameter
is passed. \\ 
Finally, when the `\textit{Off}' parameter is passed, all the cases are plot on a single figure, with 
a randomized color palette.
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \phantomsection
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Sources/Plots_and_Pictures/Payload_range.png}
    \label{Payload_Range}
    \caption{Payload Range}
\end{figure}
\clearpage

As expected, the same fuel conditions for each sample case will produce the same slopes for each segment; moreover a higher
payload implies a higher MTOW (provided that all other factors are equalized), which in turn will reduce total range.\\ 
More precisely, the surface subtended by each segment defines three different areas (from left to right respectively) [\ref{Payload_Range}]:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Maximum payload
    \item Tradeoff between fuel and payload
    \item Tradeoff between payload and range
\end{itemize}

With a maximum design range of 15000 km and a starting payload of 50 metric tonnes, 
the designed aircraft is in an area where there needs to be a tradeoff between fuel and payload.\\ 
In order to achieve that range, some payload capacity needs to be sacrificed for more fuel.\\ 
However, with a minimum goal range of 11000 km, there is still is a chance to use the highest payload possible,
while increasing fuel, as that range falls within the first segment area. \\ 
It turns out that even the Airbus A350-900 XWB (which is the target retiring aircraft) declares
a maximum range of 15000 km; however, this range is not reached at maximum payload \autocite{Airbus_A350-900}.

\pagebreak
\subsection{Assignment 2.3\label{Assignment_2.3}}
\textbf{Assignment:} Once the maximum range requirement is refined,
 identify a set of city-pairs that can be connected with no-stop flight. \\ \\ \\ 

Using an opensource tool \autocite{OSM_radius_plotter} that can plot a circle on a map, given a certain radius, and having
Rome's Fiumicino Airport as a reference point, it's clearly visible from the picture below that both the 11000 km and the 15000 km ranges
can cover a substantial portion of the globe.\\ 
The tool used is based on Open Street Map \autocite{Open_Street_Map} and Leaflet \autocite{Leaflet}, a Javascript library
designed for maps generation and development. \\

The aircraft could easily cover a continuous intercontinental flight between many of the major cities around the globe.\\ 
The following dark theme maps are from \textit{GNOME Maps} \autocite{Gnome_maps}.

For instance, it could easily link Rome to Los Angeles (10189.91 km), even at full payload
and still have fuel left.

However, an interesting way of exploiting its range, would be a hypothetical route among multiple city-pairs, with no
refuel between the trips and immediate departure. \\ \\ 
Using \textit{DistanceFromTo} \autocite{City_Distance_Calculator}, another tool built with Open Street Map and Leaflet, an example of
a route starting and coming all the way back to Rome has been estimated to be around 13899.78 km. \\ 
The route has then been drawn on the map below, using \textit{GIMP} \autocite{GIMP}. \\

\subsection{Assignment 2.4\label{Assignment_2.4}}
\textbf{Assignment:} Build the Matching Chart for your case study and define
 Wing Surface and Engine Thrust \\ \\ \\ 

 \subsubsection{Stall Velocity\label{stall_velocity}}

 Stall velocity is calculated by dividing
 the approach velocity by 1.3 (as described by regulations). \\ 
 The approach velocity is guessed by comparison with similar aicrafts, as suggested by Daniel P. Raymer \autocite{Raymer_Daniel}.\\ 
 A value of 145 knots has been chosen, as it's in between the A350-900 and A350-1000.\\ 

 \subsubsection{Key cruise parameters\label{cruise_parameters}}

 Once the necessary fuel for the 11000 km range has been consumed, the landing mass is around 214000 kg,
 which is in line with the statistical population range of $[205000, 236000] \ kg$.\\ 
 As suggested by Daniel P. Raymer \autocite{Raymer_Daniel}, an air density equivalent
 to that of sea level is assumed for all the calculations. \\ 
 The author also suggests a maximum lift coefficient between 2.2 and 3.2, thus a value
 of 2.8 has been chosen.\\ 
 Given the density, the stall velocity and the maximum lift coefficient, the function \autocite{Airbus_replacement_repo}
 \begin{verbatim}
    wing_load_distribution.m
 \end{verbatim}
calculates the $\frac{W}{S}$  $[\frac{kg}{m^2}]$, which is going to be a recurring variable later on.
With a result of $575.60 \ \frac{kg}{m^2}$ the value is in the established range. 

Using the design \textit{MTOW}, the estimated wing surface is $489.97 \ m^2$. \\ 

It is crucial that the wing load's numerator is converted to \textit{N}, in order to get a dimensionless
Thrust to Weight ratio.\\ 
The ratio is calculated for the maximum cruise speed, by the function 
\begin{verbatim}
    thrust_weight_max_speed.m
\end{verbatim}



\clearpage

The ratio is then calculated by taking the \textit{TOP} (Take Off Parameter) into account, by the function 
\begin{verbatim}
    thrust_weight_TOP.m
\end{verbatim}
which takes the lift coefficient at takeoff as an input.\\ 

The \textit{TOP} is estimated to be around $230 \ \frac{lbs}{ft^2}$, with a \textit{ground roll distance}
of 3000 ft (888 m) and a 1.7 times higher \textit{over 50 feet distance}.\\ 
As suggested by Jan Roskam \autocite{Roskam}, the lift coefficient at takeoff is the maximum lift coefficient
divided by a factor of 1.21. \\ 

Another equation for the Thrust to Weight ratio is based on the \textit{ROC} (Rate Of Climb), 
and has been implemented into the function

\begin{verbatim}
    thrust_weight_ROC.m
\end{verbatim}
\clearpage
\subsubsection{Design Point and Matching Chart\label{Matching_chart}}

The design point has been chosen in a way that minimizes wing surface, which in turns
increases the necessary thrust.

However, since the available thrust of the chosen engine is substantially higher than initially
planned, the tradeoff is acceptable.

\section{Assignment 3\label{Assignment_3}}

\subsection{Assignment 3.1\label{Assignment_3.1}}

\textbf{\textit{Assignment:}} Following the procedure suggested in the previous charts,
and on the basis of the parameters estimated in previous assignments,
define your own wing airfoil. \\ \\ \\ 

Initially, the profile that was opted for was the \textit{GOE 682}, with a 30 degrees sweep angle, 
as suggested by Daniel P. Raymer \autocite{Raymer_Daniel}.

However, that allowed for a suboptimal \textit{set angle} of 1 degree, thus leading to another alternative.

After some research on \textit{Airfoiltools} \autocite{Airfoiltools}, the final choice was in favor
of the \textit{NACA1412}, which provides a maximum lift coefficient of 1.51, as well as an ideal lift coefficient
for a \textit{set angle} of 3.5 degrees.

The maximum lift coefficient should be more than enough and actually a good safety margin 
for a stall scenario.

In addition to this, the presence of \textit{HLD} (High Lift Devices) has been assumed, with 
a 0.9 and 0.4 lift coefficient contribution for flaps and slats, respectively (as suggested by Mohammad H. Sadraey \autocite{Sadraey_Mohammad}).\\ 

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \phantomsection
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Sources/Plots_and_Pictures/NACA1412.png}
    \caption{NACA1412}
    \label{NACA1412}
\end{figure}
\clearpage

The function \autocite{Airbus_replacement_repo} 
\begin{verbatim}
    max_gross_lift_coeff_calculator.m
\end{verbatim}
calculates the \textit{gross lift coefficient}.\\

Given an \textit{Aspect Ratio} of 9, the wing surface and its \textit{sweep angles} of $ \{29, 18 \} \ deg$,
the function 
\begin{verbatim}
    wing_profile_plotter.m
\end{verbatim}
plots the wing profile, as seen from an above POV, while also returning a \textit{Taper Ratio} of 0.31915.\\ 

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \phantomsection
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Sources/Plots_and_Pictures/Main_Wing.png}
    \caption{Main Wing}
    \label{Main_wing}
\end{figure}

The function is also used later on to plot the tail wings, as it requires the type of wing to plot as one of its inputs.\\
\clearpage

As the highest \textit{Reynolds} given by \textit{Airfoiltools} is $10^6$, a comparative check on the 
actual \textit{Reynolds} should be run, in order to see whether the values given by the website are 
accurate or not.\\ 
For this purpose, the needed \textit{MAC} (Mean Aerodynamic Center) is calculated by the 
function \autocite{Airbus_replacement_repo}
\begin{verbatim}
    mean_aerodynamic_center.m
\end{verbatim}
which is based on an approximation given by Daniel P. Raymer \autocite{Raymer_Daniel}. \\ 

Then, the current \textit{Reynolds} is compared to the maximum value given by the website, by the function

\begin{verbatim}
    reynolds_check.m
\end{verbatim}

As hoped, the values are not too different, thus validating the rest of the data.\\

\section{Assignment 1.1}

\textbf{Assignment}: To write down an initial list of requirements for an
aircraft that shall replace A350, with an entry into service in 2030.
Please, while listing the requirements, refer to the categories
reported in Sect.1.4
\newline

\textbf{\textit{List of Requirements}}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Item 1
    \item Item 2
    \item Item 3
    \item Item 4
    \item \dots
    \item Item N
    \begin{itemize}
        \item SubItem 1 
        \item SubItem 2
        \item \dots
        \item Subitem M
    
    \end{itemize}
    \item Item N+1
\end{itemize}

\section{Assignment 1.2}
\textbf{Assignment}: On the basis of the list of Requirements elicited
in the previous step, identify a good list of reference aircraft and
collect data to be used as meaningful statistical population.

\section{Assignment 1.3}
\textbf{Assignment}: \textit{Critical Analysis of statistical trends}.
Verify whether your statistical population fits the trend reported in
literature (e.g. Raymer) or suggest improvements to the simple
mathematical models (e.g. updates of coefficients).

\section{Assignment 1.4}
\textbf{Assignment}: \textit{Guess data estimation for the reference
case study}. Apply the original or improved statistical trends to
perform the first guess data estimation for the reference case
study. Please, report all iterations needed to convergence to the
design maximum take-off mass. An example of iterations is
reported into [1], pages 43-52.

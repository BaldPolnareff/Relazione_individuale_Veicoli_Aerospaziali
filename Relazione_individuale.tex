\section{Assignment 1\label{Assignment_1}}
\subsection{Assignment 1.1\label{Assignment_1.1}}

\textbf{Assignment}: Write down an initial list of requirements for an
aircraft that shall replace A350, with an entry into service in 2030.
Please, while listing the requirements, refer to the categories
reported in Sect.1.4
\newline
\newline
\textbf{\textit{List of Requirements}}\\\\ (Mainly based on Airbus A350-900 \autocite{Airbus_A350-900})
\\ 

\textbf{Design and Performance\label{Design_and_performance}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Number of pilots: 2
    \item Cruise Mach: 0.85
    \item Max Operating Speed Mach: 0.9
    \item Cabin Crew: 8 (2 for each emergency exit)
    \item Number of passengers: 440
    \item Wing Span: under 70 m
    \item Fuselage Length: under 75 m
    \item Range: over 15000 km
    \item Height: under 18 m
    \item Wing Surface: 450 m²
    \item Max Payload: over 50 metric tonnes
    \item Number of engines: 2
\end{itemize}

The market analysis took several competitors into account, aiming to give birth to a brand new product, with overall improvements
in performance, while also focusing on environmental sustainability and cost reduction, whenever possible. \\ 
\clearpage 
\textbf{Operational requirements\label{Operational_requirements}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Cruise altitude: 10 - 13 km
    \item Turn around time: under 60 mins
    \item Takeoff distance: under 2 km
    \item Landing distance: under 2.5 km
    \item Rate of climb: 3000 ft/min (Initial climb)
    \item Ceiling: 13.15 km (FL431)
\end{itemize}

The mission analysis and its breaking down into phases aimed to identify certain vital \textit{operational requirements} that need to be satisfied. \\ \\ 

\textbf{Analysis of applicable regulations\label{Analysis_applicable_regulations}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Number of exits: 8
    \item External noise (on land, 5km distance) takeoff: under 90 dB
    \item External noise (on land, 5 km distance) landing: under 95 dB
    %\item N max in condizioni operative: 2.5
    %\item N min in condizioni operative: -1
\end{itemize}

Any aircraft is tightly bound to strict regulations (especially when it comes to safety), during all stages of its design, 
manufacturing and production, operation and maintenance, retirement and disposal.

These regulations include, among many others, limits regarding noise pollution.

For a large jet transport, the regulations to refer to (in Europe) are the \textit{CS-25} from \textit{EASA} \autocite{EASA_CS25}.

Considering that the aircraft is supposed to be released in the year 2030, one thing to notice
is the fact that regulations might receive updates, especially those concerning emissions and environmental sustainability in general.

\clearpage
\subsection{Assignment 1.2\label{Assignment_1.2}}
\textbf{Assignment}: On the basis of the list of Requirements elicited
in the previous step, identify a good list of reference aircraft and
collect data to be used as meaningful statistical population.\\ \\ \\ 

Several commercial aicrafts from \textit{Airbus} and \textit{Boeing} have been chosen, with
the goal of having a statistical population to compare to in mind, as well as a reference list for 
inspiration with consolidated concept designs and technologies.
The statistical sample includes some aircrafts that are not strictly comparable in size to the A350, as this
creates a more varied population, as well as outliars, to better represent a wider \textit{jet transport} category.\\
Acquiring all the data for the entire population was not easy, as their availability is scattered and varies from source
to source.\\
Despite the overall scarcity of clear, organized and transparent information, a significant amount of statistically meaningful
data has been acquired and ordered in the following landscape tables.\\ \\ 
A \textit{GNU/Octave} \autocite{Octave} (or Matlab) script that elaborates all the data has been written, with the goal
of easy readability in mind, as everything has been split into functions. \\
The script and its functions are publicly available in this works' \textit{GitHub} repository \autocite{Airbus_replacement_repo} (\textit{Code} directory) and 
licensed under the \textit{GNU GPL v3} license.\\ 
Bear in mind that Octave outputs all the plots at once when you run the whole script, while on Matlab
you may need to run each separate Section, as some versions overwrite \textit{figure()} when it's implemented
within a custom function.\\ 
This will of course depend on the Matlab version you're currently running.\\ The code itself is short and easy to read,
while also being full of step-by-step comments.

\subsection{Assignment 1.3\label{Assignment_1.3}}
\textbf{Assignment}: \textit{Critical Analysis of statistical trends}.
Verify whether your statistical population fits the trend reported in
literature (e.g. Raymer) or suggest improvements to the simple
mathematical models (e.g. updates of coefficients).\\ \\ \\ 

Among all of the acquired data, the \textit{Empty Mass Fraction} is a particularly significant
statistical trend, as it allows a preliminary guess on the involved masses. \\

This fraction is the ratio between \textit{Empty Mass} and \textit{MTOW}, driven by coefficients A = 1.3485
and b = -0.0782, as follows:
\begin{equation}
    \phantomsection
    \label{empty_mass_fraction_equation}
    \frac{M_e}{MTOW} = A\cdot MTOW^{b} 
\end{equation}

The raw data trend has been comparatively plot in the script, along with the mentioned improved algorithm, 
proposed by \textit{Daniel P. Raymer} \autocite{Raymer_Daniel}, with the only difference that
the coefficients have been calculated by interpolation of the expanded statistical population, since
the ones given in the book (published in 1992) were not adequate for more modern aircrafts.

\begin{figure}[h!]

    \label{Empty_mass_trend}
    \caption{\textit{Empty Mass Trend}}
\end{figure} 

As clearly visible, the improved trend is substantially more in line with the acquired data.


\clearpage
\subsection{Assignment 1.4\label{Assignments_1.4}}
\textbf{Assignment}: \textit{Guess data estimation for the reference
case study}. Apply the original or improved statistical trends to
perform the first guess data estimation for the reference case
study. Please, report all iterations needed to converge to the
design maximum take-off mass.\\ \\ \\ 

The first hypothesis for the \textit{MTOW} estimation was using the \textit{True Air Speed}
at an altitude of 10 km, as that would be a worse case scenario compared to the goal design
of a cruise Mach of 0.85. \\ 
The entire calculation is made assuming a range of 11 km and a maximum range of 15 km, as well as
a 50 metric tonnes design payload, with the awareness that a lighter payload might be necessary
in order to improve range.\\ \\
The function \begin{verbatim} mtow_range_plotter.m \end{verbatim} takes a guess \textit{MTOW} value as one of its inputs, generates some mass coefficients,
elaborates and iteratively solves the equation

\begin{equation}
    \phantomsection
    \label{mtow_esitmate_equation}
    \frac{m_{crew} + m_{payload}}{1 - \frac{m_{fuel}}{MTOW} - \frac{m_{empty}}{MTOW}} 
\end{equation}

in order to return the desired \textit{MTOW} as one of its outputs (see repository \autocite{Airbus_replacement_repo} for the implementation).\\ 

The mass of the crew is estimated to be 680 kg, with a crew of 8 (according to \textit{CS-25} \autocite{EASA_CS25} there should be two crew members for each emergency exit, see section \ref{Assignment_4.1}) and an average human mass of 85 kg.


The mass of the payload is, as established by design, 50 metric tonnes, the \textit{Empty Mass Fraction} was calculated in 
equation (\ref{empty_mass_fraction_equation}). 

As for the \textit{Fuel Mass Ratio} coefficients, a standard mission profile has been used, such that:

\end{figure}

\clearpage

\begin{equation}
    \phantomsection
    \label{fuel_mass_equation_phase1}
    \frac{m_{fuel1}}{MTOW} = 0.97
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \phantomsection
    \label{fuel_mass_equation_phase2}
    \frac{m_{fuel2}}{m_{fuel1}} = 0.985
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \phantomsection
    \label{fuel_mass_equation_phase3}
    \frac{m_{fuel3}}{m_{fuel2}} = e^{- \frac{R \cdot sfc}{v\left(\frac{L}{D}\right) }}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \phantomsection
    \label{fuel_mass_equation_phase4}
    \frac{m_{fuel4}}{m_{fuel3}} = 0.985
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \phantomsection
    \label{fuel_mass_equation_phase5}
    \frac{m_{fuel5}}{m_{fuel4}} = 0.995
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \phantomsection
    \label{fuel_mass_equation_final}
    \frac{m_{fuel5}}{MTOW} = \prod {ratio_i} = 0.6335
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \phantomsection
    \label{fuel_mass_equation_final_corrected}
    \frac{m_{fuel}}{MTOW} = 1.06 \cdot \left(1 - \frac{m_{fuel5}}{MTOW}\right) = 0.3888 
\end{equation}


In equation (\ref{fuel_mass_equation_phase3}):

\begin{itemize}
    \item $R = 11000 \ km$ (range)
    \item $sfc = 0.478 \frac{lb}{lbf \cdot h} $ (specific fuel consumption)
    \item $v = M \cdot \sqrt{\gamma RT} = 916272 \frac{m}{h} $ (cruise speed)
    \item $\left(\frac{L}{D}\right)_{max}  = k_{LD} \cdot \sqrt{A_w} = 20$ (maximum flight efficiency)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $k_{LD} = 15.5$ (value for jet transports \autocite{Raymer_Daniel})
        \item $A_w = \frac{AR}{\frac{S_{wet}}{S_{ref}}} = 1.5833$ (wetted aspect ratio \autocite{Raymer_Daniel})
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Equation (\ref{fuel_mass_equation_final}) is the raw fuel ratio, which is corrected in equation (\ref{fuel_mass_equation_final_corrected})
by taking into account a 6 \% residual fuel, as suggested by Daniel P. Raymer \autocite{Raymer_Daniel}.\\ 

With an initial \textit{MTOW} guess of 275 metric tonnes (same as the A350 \autocite{Airbus_A350-900}), the 
final design MTOW resulted to be 282024 kg.

\clearpage 

The function finally plots the MTOW as a function of the range.\\

\clearpage
Similarly, with the function \autocite{Airbus_replacement_repo}
\begin{verbatim}

    mtow_payload_plotter.m

\end{verbatim}
the \textit{MTOW} has been plotted as a function of the payload with the design
range of 11000 km first, then with the maximum range of 15000 km, as pictured below.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering

    \label{MTOW_Payload_15}
    \caption{MTOW-Payload (15000 km)}
\end{figure}
As you can see, there are some areas of instability, where the function drops to a null value,
but that's because the MTOW ceases to have a physical meaning above or below certain
thresholds, depending on the input parameters and function implementation. \\ 
The overall trend of figures (\ref{fig:MTOW_Payload_11}, \ref{MTOW_Payload_15}) should be linear, while
there should be no lower discontinuity in the 11000 km plot.
However there seems to be a common discontinuity point, slightly above 400 metric tonnes.

\section{Assignment 2\label{Assignment_2}}
\subsection{Assignment 2.1 and 2.2\label{Assignment_2.1}}
\textbf{Assignment:} Perform a Tradeoff and identify a suitable design point that 
guarantees the aircraft concept to be competitive with A350 and competitors. \\ \\ \\ 
\textbf{Assignment:} Create a Payload-Range Diagram representative of your aircraft concept. 
On the basis of the results achieved, draw different Payload-Range diagrams to explore 
the possibility to create a family concept.\\ \\ \\ 


Another key aspect to take into consideration is how the \textit{Payload} changes with 
 range, considering that fuel contribution to the total mass is obviously going
to change over time, thus influencing other factors as well. \\ 
The fuel volume of the Airbus A350 ($141 \ m^3$) as well as
the fuel itself (\textit{AVGAS}) have been taken as a reference point.\\ 
In order to better represent this function within a family of aircrafts that
is compatible with our statistical sample, a variation around the design point values has been 
taken into account.\\ 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Payload variation: $\pm \ 5000 \ kg$
    \item MTOW variation: $\left \{ {0.88 \ MTOW, 1.077 \ MTOW} \right \} \ kg$
    \item Range variation: $\pm \ 500 \ km$
\end{itemize}

The result is calculated and plotted with the function \autocite{Airbus_replacement_repo}
\begin{verbatim}
    payload_range_plotter.m
\end{verbatim}
which takes into consideration all the parameters involving the fuel, as well as other design values for the airplane.\\ 
The plotter can be called with input variations as many times as the user needs, while the `\textit{On}' parameter
is passed. \\ 
Finally, when the `\textit{Off}' parameter is passed, all the cases are plot on a single figure, with 
a randomized color palette.
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \phantomsection
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Sources/Plots_and_Pictures/Payload_range.png}
    \label{Payload_Range}
    \caption{Payload Range}
\end{figure}
\clearpage

As expected, the same fuel conditions for each sample case will produce a similar linear trend for each segment; moreover a higher
payload implies a higher MTOW (provided that all other factors are equalized), which in turn will reduce total range.\\ 
More precisely, the surface subtended by each segment defines three different areas (from left to right respectively) [\ref{Payload_Range}]:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Maximum payload}: \\ 
        In this area, payload mass is constant at its maximum value (50 metric tonnes), while fuel tanks are
        filled until the highest MTOW is reached. 
        \begin{equation}
            \phantomsection
            m_{fuel} = MTOW - A \cdot MTOW^{b+1} - m_{crew} - m_{payload}
            \label{payload_range_fuel_mass}
        \end{equation}
    \item \textit{Tradeoff between fuel and payload}: \\ 
        The highest MTOW has been reached, however there's still space left in the tanks for more fuel.
        The MTOW should not vary, thus the fuel capacity can be increased at the expense of the payload mass.
    \item \textit{Tradeoff between payload and range}: \\ 
        Since the MTOW can't vary and the fuel tanks are completely full, the only way to increase range is cutting down
        on some payload mass.
\end{itemize}

With a maximum design range of 15000 km and a starting payload of 50 metric tonnes, 
the designed aircraft is in an area where there needs to be a tradeoff between fuel and payload.\\ 
In order to achieve that range, some payload capacity needs to be sacrificed for more fuel.\\ 
However, with a minimum goal range of 11000 km, there is still is a chance to use the highest payload possible,
while increasing fuel, as that range falls within the first segment area. \\ 
It turns out that even the Airbus A350-900 XWB (which is the target retiring aircraft) declares
a maximum range of 15000 km; however, taking a deeper look at the data, this range is not reached at maximum payload \autocite{Airbus_A350-900}.

\subsection{Assignment 2.3\label{Assignment_2.3}}
\textbf{Assignment:} Once the maximum range requirement is refined,
 identify a set of city-pairs that can be connected with no-stop flight. \\ \\ \\ 

Using an opensource tool \autocite{OSM_radius_plotter} that can plot a circle on a map, given a certain radius, and having
Rome's Fiumicino Airport as a reference point, it's clearly visible from the picture below that both the 11000 km and the 15000 km ranges
can cover a substantial portion of the globe.\\ 
The tool used is based on Open Street Map \autocite{Open_Street_Map} and Leaflet \autocite{Leaflet}, a Javascript library
designed for maps generation and development. \\ 

\begin{figure}[h!]

    but the maximum range exceeds the global scale of the map, which shifts the largest circle}
    \label{Global_Coverage}
\end{figure}
\clearpage

The aircraft could easily cover a continuous intercontinental flight between many of the major cities around the globe.\\ 
The following dark theme maps are from \textit{GNOME Maps} \autocite{Gnome_maps}.

    \caption{Many major cities linked with Rome}

For instance, it could easily link Rome to Los Angeles (10189.91 km), even at full payload
and still have fuel left.

A few more examples: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Rome - Las Vegas (9834.85 km, full payload)
    \item Rome - Toronto (7081.70 km, full payload)
    \item Rome - Vancouver (8992.46 km, full payload)
    \item Rome - Mexico City (10240.82 km, full payload)
    \item Rome - Lima (10861.53 km, full payload)
    \item Rome - Beijing (8122.88 km, full payload)
    \item Rome - Tokyo (9857.88 km, full payload)
    \item Rome - Cape Town (8452.22 km, full payload)
    \item Rome - Buenos Aires (11150.43 km)
\end{itemize}


\clearpage



However, an interesting way of exploiting its range, would be a hypothetical route among multiple city-pairs, with no
refuel between the trips and immediate departure. \\ \\ 
Using \textit{DistanceFromTo} \autocite{City_Distance_Calculator}, another tool built with Open Street Map and Leaflet, an example of
a route starting and coming all the way back to Rome has been estimated to be around 13899.78 km. \\ 
The route has then been drawn on the map below, using \textit{GIMP} \autocite{GIMP}. \\

\subsection{Assignment 2.4\label{Assignment_2.4}}
\textbf{Assignment:} Build the Matching Chart for your case study and define
 Wing Surface and Engine Thrust \\ \\ \\ 

 \subsubsection{Stall Velocity\label{stall_velocity}}

 Stall velocity has been derived from the \textit{Wing Load} equation: 

 \begin{equation}
     \phantomsection
     \label{wing_load_equation}
     \frac{W}{S} = \frac{1}{2} \rho V^{2}_{stall} C_{L_{max}} 
 \end{equation}
 
 
 It has been calculated by dividing
 the approach velocity by 1.3, as this safety factor takes into account possible \textit{wind shear} phenomena (as described by Daniel P. Raymer \autocite{Raymer_Daniel}). \\ 
 The approach velocity has been guessed by comparison with similar aircrafts, as suggested again by the author.\\ 
 A value of 145 knots ($74.59444 \ m/s$) has been chosen, as it's in between the A350-900 and A350-1000.\\ 
 Density is assumed to be $\rho = 1.225 \frac{kg}{m^3}$ (sea level). \\ 

 \subsubsection{Key cruise parameters\label{cruise_parameters}}

 Once the necessary fuel for the 11000 km range has been consumed, the landing mass is around 214000 kg,
 which is in line with the statistical population range of $[205000, 236000] \ kg$.\\ 
 As suggested by Daniel P. Raymer \autocite{Raymer_Daniel}, an air density equivalent
 to that of sea level is assumed for all the calculations. \\ 
 The author also suggests a maximum lift coefficient between 2.2 and 3.2, thus a value
 of 2.8 has been chosen.\\ 
 Given the density, the stall velocity and the maximum lift coefficient, the function \autocite{Airbus_replacement_repo}
 \begin{verbatim}
    wing_load_distribution.m
 \end{verbatim}
calculates the $\frac{W}{S}$  $[\frac{kg}{m^2}]$, which is going to be a recurring variable later on.
With a result of $575.60 \ \frac{kg}{m^2}$ the value is in the established range. 

Using the design \textit{MTOW}, the estimated wing surface is $489.97 \ m^2$. \\ 

It is crucial that the wing load's numerator is converted to \textit{N}, in order to get a dimensionless
Thrust to Weight ratio.\\ 
\begin{equation}
    \phantomsection
    \label{thrust_weight_equation}
    \frac{T}{W} = \frac{\rho_0 V^{2}_{max}C_{D_{0}}}{2\frac{W}{S}} + \frac{2KW}{\rho \sigma S V^{2}_{max}}
\end{equation}

In equation (\ref{thrust_weight_equation}):
\begin{itemize}
    \item $V_{max} = 1.25 \ V_{cruise} = 318.15 \ m/s$
    \item $\sigma = \frac{\rho}{\rho_0} = 0.2607$
    \item $C_{D_{0}} = 0.015$ (value for \textit{jet transport} \autocite{Sadraey_Mohammad})
    \item $K = \frac{1}{\pi e AR}$
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $e = 0.92$ (\textit{Oswald efficiency number})
            \item $AR = 9$ (Design \textit{Aspect Ratio})
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The ratio is calculated for the maximum cruise speed condition, by the function 
\begin{verbatim}
    thrust_weight_max_speed.m
\end{verbatim}


The ratio is then calculated by taking the \textit{TOP} (Take Off Parameter) into account, by the function 
\begin{verbatim}
    thrust_weight_TOP.m
\end{verbatim}
which takes the lift coefficient at takeoff as an input.\\ 

The \textit{TOP} is a takeoff parameter, strictly correlated with the \textit{Takeoff Run} (see section \ref{Assignment_6.5}) and associated
with the \textit{Thrust to Weight ratio} by the equation:

\begin{equation}
    \phantomsection
    \label{thrust_weight_equation_TOP}
    \frac{W}{S} = \left(TOP\right)\sigma C_{L_{TO}} \frac{T}{W} 
\end{equation}

The \textit{TOP} is estimated to be around $230 \ \frac{lbs}{ft^2}$ ($1114.1 \ \frac{kg}{m^2}$), with a \textit{ground roll distance}
of 3000 ft (888 m) and a 1.7 times higher \textit{over 50 feet distance}.\\ 

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \phantomsection
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Sources/Plots_and_Pictures/TOP.png}
    \caption{Takeoff Distance - TOP \autocite{Raymer_Daniel}}
    \label{TOP}
\end{figure}
As suggested by Jan Roskam \autocite{Roskam}, the lift coefficient at takeoff is the maximum lift coefficient
divided by a factor of 1.21. \\ 

Another equation for the Thrust to Weight ratio is based on the \textit{ROC} (Rate Of Climb):

\begin{equation}
    \phantomsection
    \label{ROC}
    \frac{T}{W} = \frac{ROC}{\sqrt{\frac{2\frac{W}{S}}{\rho \sqrt{\frac{C_{D0_{TO}}}{K}}}}} + \frac{1}{\left(\frac{L}{D}_{max}\right)}
\end{equation}

In equation (\ref{ROC}):

\begin{itemize}
    \item $ROC = 3000 \ ft/min (15.24 \ m/s)$ 
    \item $C_{D0_{TO}} = 0.0950$ (with landing gear and high-lift devices \autocite{Raymer_Daniel})
\end{itemize}

It has been implemented into the function

\begin{verbatim}
    thrust_weight_ROC.m
\end{verbatim}

which takes the \textit{ROC} as one of its inputs. \\ 

The \textit{ceiling}, which is the altitude with a $ROC = 0$ has been plot with the built-in 
\textit{line()} function and was derived from the equation:

\begin{equation}
    \phantomsection
    \label{ceiling_equation}
    \frac{T}{W} = \frac{1}{\sigma_c \left(\frac{L}{D}\right)_{max}}
\end{equation}

In equation (\ref{ceiling_equation}:)

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\sigma_c = \frac{\rho_c}{\rho_0} = 0.2537$
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $\rho_c = 0.311 \frac{kg}{m^3}$
            \item $\rho_0 = 1.225 \frac{kg}{m^3}$
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Finally, knowing the $\frac{W}{S}$, the design \textit{MTOW} and the \textit{Thrust to Weight Ratio} at takeoff, 
the function 
\begin{verbatim}
    thrust_design.m
\end{verbatim}

calculates the design \textit{Required Thrust}, which amounts to 691849 N.

\clearpage

\subsubsection{Design Point and Matching Chart\label{Matching_chart}}

The design point has been chosen in a way that minimizes wing surface, which in turn
increases the necessary thrust.

However, since the available thrust of the chosen engine is substantially higher than initially
planned, the tradeoff is acceptable (see section \ref{Assignment_6.2}).

\section{Assignment 3\label{Assignment_3}}

\subsection{Assignment 3.1\label{Assignment_3.1}}

\textbf{\textit{Assignment:}} Following the procedure suggested in the previous charts,
and on the basis of the parameters estimated in previous assignments,
define your own wing airfoil. \\ \\ \\ 

A \textit{Low Wing} architecture has been chosen, as it's standard with \textit{jet transport} airplanes,
since it provides the best compromise between overall performance and aerodynamic performance.\\ 

Desired targets for the profile research were: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Avoiding \textit{Sharp Leading Edge} profiles, which are not optimized for high-subsonic flights
    \item Looking for \textit{Double Cambered} profiles, which perform better than flat lower-profile airfoils
    \item Maximizing the $\left(\frac{t}{c}\right)_{max}$, within reason, in order to increase inner wing volume for subsystems or fuel tanks.
\end{itemize}

Initially, the profile that was opted for was the \textit{GOE 682}, with a 30 degrees sweep angle, 
as suggested by Daniel P. Raymer \autocite{Raymer_Daniel}.

However, that allowed for a suboptimal \textit{set angle} of 1 degree, thus leading to another alternative.

After some research on \textit{Airfoiltools} \autocite{Airfoiltools}, the final choice was in favor
of the \textit{NACA1412}, which provides a maximum lift coefficient of 1.51, as well as an ideal lift coefficient
for a \textit{set angle} of 3.5 degrees.

The maximum lift coefficient should be more than enough and actually a good safety margin 
for a stall scenario.

In addition to this, the presence of \textit{HLD} (High Lift Devices) has been assumed, with 
a 0.9 and 0.4 lift coefficient contribution for flaps and slats, respectively (as suggested by Mohammad H. Sadraey \autocite{Sadraey_Mohammad}).\\ 

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \phantomsection
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Sources/Plots_and_Pictures/NACA1412.png}
    \caption{NACA1412}
    \label{NACA1412}
\end{figure}
\clearpage

This profile satisfied all of the following requirements:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $C_{L_c} = \frac{2W_{mean}}{\rho V_c S} = 0.4371$ (\textit{Ideal cruise lift coefficient})
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $W_{mean} = \frac{W_{startcruise}+W_{endcruise}}{2}$
        \end{itemize}
    \item $C_{L_cw} = \frac{C_{L_c}}{k_w} = 0.4601$ (\textit{Wing lift coefficient})
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $k_w = 0.95$
        \end{itemize}
    \item $C_{L_i} = \frac{C_{L_cw}}{k_a}$ (\textit{Wing airfoil ideal lift coefficient})
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $k_a = 0.95$
        \end{itemize}
    \item $C_{L_{max}} = \frac{2W_{TO}}{\rho_0 (1.1 \ V_s)^2S} = 2.3140$ (\textit{Aircraft maximum lift coefficient})
    \item $C_{L_{max_{w}}} = \frac{C_{L_{max}}}{k_w} = 2.4358$ (\textit{Wing maximum lift coefficient})
    \item $C_{l_{maxgross}} = \frac{C_{L_{max_{w}}}}{k_a} = 2.7065$ (\textit{Airfoil maximum gross lift coefficient}) \\ \\ 
        Calculated by the function \autocite{Airbus_replacement_repo} 
        \begin{verbatim}
            max_gross_lift_coeff_calculator.m
        \end{verbatim}

    \item $C_{l_{max}} = C_{l_{maxgross}} - \Delta C_{l_{HLD}} = 1.4065$ (\textit{Wing airfoil net maximum lift coefficient})
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $\Delta C_{l_{HLD}} = \Delta C_{l_{FLAP}} + \Delta C_{l_{SLAT}} = 1.3$
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Assignment 3.2\label{Assignment_3.2}}

\textbf{\textit{Assignment:}} Once the airfoil has been selected, look for reference materials
showing aerodynamic coefficients trends. 
Are they in line with your expectations (and requirements)? \\ \\ \\ 

As the highest \textit{Reynolds} given by \textit{Airfoiltools} is $10^6$, a comparative check on the 
actual \textit{Reynolds} should be run, in order to see whether the values given by the website are 
accurate or not.\\ 
For this purpose, the needed \textit{MAC} (Mean Aerodynamic Center) is calculated by the 
function \autocite{Airbus_replacement_repo}
\begin{verbatim}
    mean_aerodynamic_center.m
\end{verbatim}
which is based on an approximation given by Daniel P. Raymer \autocite{Raymer_Daniel}. \\

The result is $MAC = 8.0336 \ m$ \\ 

Then, the current \textit{Reynolds} is compared to the maximum value given by the website, by the function

\begin{verbatim}
    reynolds_check.m
\end{verbatim}

As hoped, the values are not too different, thus validating the rest of the data.\\ 

\clearpage

\subsection{Assignment 3.3\label{Assignment_3.3}}

\textbf{\textit{Assignment:}} Once the wing airfoil is selected, please, 
try to identify the main parameters for a 3D wing. \\ \\ \\ 

As anticipated in section \ref{Assignment_3.2}: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\alpha_w = 3.5^{\circ}$ (\textit{Angle of attack}) \\ 
        This is the angle of incidence that grants an ideal lift coefficient, as seen from the \textit{Airfoiltools}
        \autocite{Airfoiltools} data for the chosen profile and it's in the range of $3^{\circ} \ to \ 5^{\circ}$, 
        which is appropriate for \textit{jet transport} aircrafts, as suggested by Mohammad H. Sadraey \autocite{Sadraey_Mohammad}.
    \item $AR = 9$ (\textit{Aspect Ratio}) \\ 
        As established by design. 
    \item $b = \sqrt{AR \cdot S} = 66.406 \ m$ (\textit{Wing span}) \\ 
        Given by the function \autocite{Airbus_replacement_repo}: 

        \begin{verbatim}
            wing_span_calculator.m
        \end{verbatim}
    \item $\vec{\Lambda} = \binom{29^{\circ}}{18^{\circ}}$ (\textit{Sweep angles})
    \item $\lambda = \frac{c_{tip}}{c_{root}} = 0.31915$ (\textit{Taper Ratio}, see section \ref{Assignment_3.2})
    \item $\Gamma = 5^{\circ}$ (\textit{Dihedral Angle}) \\
        Typically between $3^{\circ} \ and \ 8^{\circ}$ for \textit{Low Wing} architectures in 
        high-subsonic flights.
\end{itemize}
\clearpage 

Given an \textit{Aspect Ratio} of 9, the wing surface and its \textit{sweep angles} of $ \{29, 18 \} \ deg$,
the function 
\begin{verbatim}
    wing_profile_plotter.m
\end{verbatim}
plots the wing profile, as seen from an above POV, while also returning a \textit{Taper Ratio} of 0.31915.\\

Once renormalized for $c_{root} = 11.1866 \ m$ and $c_{tip} = 3.5702 \ m$, as well as for
 \textit{sweep angles} and \textit{dihedral angle} in a \textit{LibreOffice Calc}
spreadsheet \autocite{libreoffice}, the raw data can 
be imported in \textit{Solidworks}, in order to create two \textit{splines}, distanced in 3D space
and later joined by the \textit{loft} function.

Once the semi-wing has been created, the entire wing was simply created with a \textit{mirror} function.

\section{Assignment 4\label{Assignment_4}}

\subsection{Assignment 4.1\label{Assignment_4.1}}

\textbf{\textit{Assignment:}} Design your fuselage following the suggested methodology\\ \\ \\ 

The general procedure was implemented following Muhammad H. Sadraey's workflow and suggested values \autocite{Sadraey_Mohammad},
and by taking the \textit{EASA CS-25.807, Amendment 3} \autocite{EASA_CS25} regulations into account.\\ 

The configuration that was opted for is the following, with comfort standards increasing with class tier: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Business} (26 seats)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 1, 2, 1
            \begin{itemize}

            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textit{First Class} (48 seats)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 2, 2, 2
            \begin{itemize}
                \item $\left ( 60, 92, 60 \right ) \ cm$ \\ (Corridor Width, Room between seats, Seat Width)
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textit{Economy Class} (315 seats)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 3, 3, 3
            \begin{itemize}
                \item $\left ( 50, 72, 46 \right ) \ cm$ \\ (Corridor Width, Room between seats, Seat Width)
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

As suggested by the author, the nose length is calculated with a slightly different
formula for each class and the tail zone is 1 m longer than the nose. 

The doors dimensions are strictly tied to the regulations and both the number and type have been 
chosen accordingly, as visible in the CAD model. 
Furthermore, a thickness of 105 mm has been added to the fuselage circular section area, as established by regulations. 

Four \textit{1X1 m} toilet modules have been installed (and considered in the calculations) on each side, plus two more in between the 
\textit{Economy} and the \textit{First class}, this time according to Daniel P. Raymer \autocite{Raymer_Daniel}.\\ 

The function \autocite{Airbus_replacement_repo}
\begin{verbatim}
    passenger_mass_calculator.m
\end{verbatim}

estimates and returns a vector with the mass of passengers for each available class, based on the number of seats and
the average human mass, as well as an extra mass budget for each seat, which varies with the class itself.\\ 

The resulting mass is $\left \{ 3328,  \  6144, \  37485 \right \} \ kg$ for Business, First Class and Economy respectively. \\ 

The function 
\begin{verbatim}
    fuselage_size_calculator.m
\end{verbatim}

accepts as inputs each class' geometry vectors, as well as a vector with the number of seats for each class, 
and returns a dimensions vector for each class, as well as the total fuselage length. \\ 

The results are the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Business Dimensions} (W X L)
        \subitem  $\left \{4.4000, \ 6.7600 \right \} \ m$
    \item \textit{First Class Dimensions} (W X L)
        \subitem  $\left \{4.8000, \ 7.3600 \right \} \ m$
    \item \textit{Economy Dimensions} (W X L)
        \subitem  $\left \{5.1400, \ 25.2000 \right \} \ m$
    \item \textit{Total Fuselage Length}
        \subitem  67.304 m
    \item \textit{Total Fuselage Diameter}
        \subitem $5.14 \ m + \ 2 \cdot 0.105 \ m = 5.344 \ m$

The fuselage has been created with a traditional CAD workflow. 

Planar geometry of each class'

seen in section \ref{Assignment_4.1}. 

The \textit{loft} function has been used 
to join the reference sketches with a cylinder surface of constant radius.

With the help of longitudinal curved guidelines, nose and tail surfaces have been once again

\section{Assignment 5\label{Assignment_5}}

\subsection{Assignment 5.1\label{Assignment_5.1}}

\textbf{\textit{Assignment:}} Select and briefly justify the most appropriate
 tail configuration for your case study \\ \\ \\ 

The conventional or inverted T-shape configuration was an immediate choice, as it's a simple, widely
used and yet effective design. 

In addition to this, as suggested by Mohammad H. Sadraey \autocite{Sadraey_Mohammad}, this traditional design is more appropriate
for inexperienced aircraft designers. \\ 

This configuration includes one horizontal tail mounted on the
aft fuselage and one vertical tail on top of the aft fuselage.

While they both deal with various stability requirements, the former handles longitudinal trim, 
the latter handles directional trim. \\

\subsection{Assignment 5.2\label{Assignment_5.2}}

\textbf{\textit{Assignment:}} Follow the procedure reported in these charts
 and size your horizontal tail plane. \\ \\ \\ 

As once again suggested by Mohammad H. Sadraey \autocite{Sadraey_Mohammad}, a \textit{NACA0009} profile 
has been chosen, as it's symmetric and not excessively thick, compared to the main wing profile. \\

\clearpage


 The function \autocite{Airbus_replacement_repo}

\begin{verbatim}
    tail_surface_calculator.m
\end{verbatim}

has been implemented: it evaluates the optimal distance and use it to return the wing surface, following the author's workflow,
based on the equations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $V_H = \frac{lS_H}{CS}$
    \item $l_{opt} = K_c \sqrt{\frac{4CSV_H}{\pi D_f}}$
\end{itemize}

The same function is later used to calculate the vertical wing's surface, as it takes the tail wing type as one of the inputs.

The result was a $94.435 \ m^2$ surface. \\ 

The Taper Ratio is recommended to be between 0.4 and 0.7 (mostly for weight reduction), thus a value of 0.6 has been chosen.

This allows for a wing span of 20 m, which is comparable to the 18 m of the A350. \\ 

As for the set angle, the function \autocite{Airbus_replacement_repo}

\begin{verbatim}
    set_angle_calculator.m
\end{verbatim}

returns its value, after taking some typical wing angles as an input. The assumption made was that of horizontal
cruise, at constant velocity. \\ 

The function 

\begin{verbatim}
    horizontal_tail_aero_coefficients_calculator.m
\end{verbatim}

calculates a pair of useful aerodynamic coefficients for the tail wing, returning the following values:

\begin{itemize}
    \item ${C_{M0}^{\ (wing body)} = -0.014731} $
    \item ${C_{L}^{\ (tail)}} = 0.069604$
\end{itemize}


\clearpage

The sweep angles and the dihedral angle are the same as the main wing, the \textit{MAC} (Mean Aerodynamic Center) is calculated
and the wing is plotted with the same functions implemented for the main wing in section \ref{Assignment_3.1}.

\subsection{Assignment 5.3\label{Assignment_5.3}}

\textbf{\textit{Assignment:}} Follow the procedure reported in these charts
 and size your vertical tail plane. \\ \\ \\ 

The procedure for the vertical tail wing is very similar to the horizontal one and, as suggested by 
Mohammad H. Sadraey \autocite{Sadraey_Mohammad}, the optimal distance between the \textit{MAC} and the tail
is the same as the horizontal one.\\ 

The \textit{NACA0009} \autocite{Airfoiltools} has been chosen again, mostly for its symmetry and relatively
low thickness.\\ 

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \phantomsection
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Sources/Plots_and_Pictures/NACA0009.png}
    \caption{NACA0009 \autocite{Airfoiltools}}
    \label{NACA0009_vert}
\end{figure}

The set angle is null, as the aircraft is equipped with twin engines that provide a symmetrical and 
equally distributed thrust, unlike single front fan aircrafts, where a set angle might be used
in order to compensate the net reaction torque generated by the single engine. 

The \textit{Aspect Ratio} and the \textit{Taper Ratio} have been kept equal to those of the Airbus A350-900 \autocite{Airbus_A350-900}.

As suggested by Mohammad H. Sadraey \autocite{Sadraey_Mohammad}, the highest \textit{Sweep Angle} has been
chosen to be $35^{\circ}$, which is in line with the statistical population as well. 

Using trigonometry, the other angle is geometrically calculated, with an estimated value of $10.767^{\circ}$. 
\clearpage 

With the workflow seen in section \ref{Assignment_5.2}, a wing surface of $210.51 \ m^2$ has been calculated
and the vertical tail wing has been plotted.

\subsection{Assignment 5.4\label{Assignment_5.4}}

\textbf{\textit{Assignment:}} Develop a CAD model 
of the sized aircraft tail \\ \\ \\ 

The workflow for both the empennages is analogous to the one seen in section \ref{Assignment_3.4}, with airfoil coordinates
being rescaled according to the profile's extreme chords, as well as being rearranged in 3D space using 
the respective sweep angles and dihedral angles and finally being joined with the \textit{loft} function 
in \textit{Solidworks}.
The \textit{mirror} function, as expected, has not been used for the vertical tail.

\section{Assignment 6\label{Assignment_6}}

\subsection{Assignment 6.1\label{Assignment_6.1}}

\textbf{\textit{Assignment:}} Apply the lifting-line theory to the 3D wing model already defined
and if necessary, indicate possible improvements to be performed to guarantee sufficient lift generation \\ \\ \\ 

Wing lift analysis is very sensitive to \textit{Taper Ratio} variations, whose value is typically between 
0.3 and 0.4 in literature, as this range allows for the minimum \textit{Lift-induced Drag}, thus leading to 
an optimal lift distribution. \\ 

The function \autocite{Airbus_replacement_repo}

\begin{verbatim}
    lifting_line_plotter.m
\end{verbatim}

is an implementation of the \textit{Lifting line theory} and is based upon a script provided by Mohammad H. Sadraey \autocite{Sadraey_Mohammad}. 

It returns the wing's \textit{Lift coefficient}, which resulted to be 0.39334 and plots the lift coefficient as a function of the semi-wingspan.

The function also runs a check to verify whether the contribution of the wing to the total lift is at least $85 \%$ (the test was passed). \\ 

This theory was developed by Prandtl and it's based on the assumption of linearization, which make it suitable for cruise
conditions only. 

The wing aerodynamic performance derived from this model can't therefore be used for more critical scenarios, like
specific maneuvers, proximity to stall conditions or landing and takeoff, which are characterized by non-linear phenomena. \\ 



\clearpage

The \textit{twist angle} is a critical parameter to take into consideration for aerodynamic improvements:
starting with a null value and after quite a bit of trial and error, a twist angle $\alpha_{twist} = -2^{\circ}$ has shown
a considerable improvement, according to the lifting line theory, as it kept the curve closer to an 
ellipse.\\ 

As mentioned earlier, the analysis is also very sensitive to \textit{Taper Ratio} variations. 

Having permanently set $\alpha_{twist} = -2^{\circ}$, after some more trial and error, a \textit{Taper Ratio} 
$TR = 0.3192$ has been found to be a significant improvement to the initial design.

Anything above this threshold would drastically diminish the wing's lift coefficient; anything below
it would output a worse distribution. \\ 

Another potential improvement could be achieved by adding \textit{winglets}, as they provide an efficient
way to reduce vorticity ad the tip of the wings.

    \phantomsection
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Sources/Plots_and_Pictures/Linea_Portante.png}

\clearpage
\subsection{Assignment 6.2\label{Assignment_6.2}}

\textbf{\textit{Assignment:}} Apply one of the two suggested methods and define your selected engine \\ \\ \\ 

As seen in section \ref{cruise_parameters}, the total \textit{Required Thrust} amounts to 691849 N, which
translates to 345.924 kN per engine, in a twin engine design.\\ 

Given its widespread use for this class of aircraft and its efficiency, the engine research focused on a 
\textit{Turbofan}, rather than a \textit{Turbojet} or \textit{Turboprop}. 

The chosen approach was that of looking for an already existing engine in the market, as there's plenty of available
options that would satisfy the requirements. \\ 

A great source of public domain information on all kinds of aeronautic engines is the well known \textit{ICAO}
database on engines' emissions \autocite{ICAO_engine_database}.

The database provides an exhaustive list of all sorts of engines, as well as accurate and up to date info on their market availability
status and, of course, their key parameters, like thrust and many others. \\ 

Having taken a good look at the database and having seen the typical options for aircrafts of the same family,
the most appealing options were \textit{Rolls Royce} and \textit{General Electric} engines. \\ 

After some more in depth research, the final choice was in favor of the \textit{General Electric GE90-94B}. 

An essential design point is that the available thrust is higher than the required one. 
This engine meets this vital requirement, while also being an overall reliable and high performance device.

\subsection{Assignment 6.3\label{Assignment_6.3}}

\textbf{\textit{Assignment:}} Verify whether or not the propulsive characteristics of the selected 
engine are in line with requirements and with the assumptions of the Conceptual Design \\ \\ \\ 

As mentioned in the previous section \ref{Assignment_6.2}, the thrust requirement is met.\\

Another important parameter is \textit{SFC} (Specific Fuel Consumption), which was initially supposed to be 
$0.478 \ \frac{lb}{lbf \ h}$  ($13.54 \ \frac{mg}{N \ s}$). 

The exact value for this engine wasn't readily available on the internet and different sources
declare different values, which are, however, all comparable to the initial guess.

In addition to this, the \textit{GE90} series have been notorious for having a lower \textit{SFC} 
than their main competitors, at the time of release (November 1995).\\ 

The initial concept design established the presence of twin turboengines, both mounted below the main wing.
This engine is generally used in this configuration with aircrafts of comparable size and performance. \\

returns:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Ground Roll Distance: 1000.2 m
    \item Takeoff Run: 1350.7 m
